When working with numbers in Python, you might need to divide one number by another. It's a common task but can quickly become tricky if you aren't careful about what you're dividing by.

The main culprit? `ZeroDivisionError` exception, or error (if you prefer it that way).

Let's look at the cause of the `ZeroDivision` exception in Python and how to fix it.

## What Causes the `ZeroDivisionError` Error in Python?

`ZeroDivision` error happens when you attempt to divide a number by `0`:

```py
print( 5 / 0) # ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

This happens because in math, dividing by zero is undefined. TO account for that, Python throws the `ZeroDivisionError` exception when you try to devide a number by 0.

Here's a better example with a function:

```py
def divideTwoNums(x, y):
  return x / y

print(divideTwoNums(6, 2)) # 3.0
print(divideTwoNums(4, 0)) # ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

## How to Fix the `ZeroDivision` Error in Python

Fixing this error means you should make sure a number is not divided by `0`. But since you might be accepting user inputs in your apps, it's possible errors like `ZeroDivision` will happen.

To avoid `ZeroDivisionError` error, you can use an `if` statement to check for it and display a custom message to the user:

```py
def divideTwoNums(x, y):
 if y == 0:
   return "You can't divide a number by zero!"
 else:
   return x / y

print(divideTwoNums(6, 2)) # 3.0
print(divideTwoNums(6, 0)) # You can't divide a number by zero!
```

The Python way to handle to prevent the `ZeroDivisionError` error is to use `try…except` instead of `if…else`:

```py
def divideTwoNums(x, y):
 try:
   return x / y
 except:
   return "You can't divide a number by zero!"

print(divideTwoNums(6, 2)) # 3.0
print(divideTwoNums(6, 0)) # You can't divide a number by zero!
```

You can take that further by specifically looking for the `ZeroDivisionError` exception:

```py
def divideTwoNums(x, y):
 try:
   return x / y
 except ZeroDivisionError:
   return "You can't divide a number by zero!"

print(divideTwoNums(6, 2)) # 3.0
print(divideTwoNums(6, 0)) # You can't divide a number by zero!
```
