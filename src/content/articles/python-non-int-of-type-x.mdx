One common error you might encounter while working with Python is `TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'list'`.

This error message might initially seem complicated, but it’s straightforward once you understand what Python expects when performing multiplication with sequences.

Continue reading, so I can show you what causes this error and how you can resolve it.

## What Causes `TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'list'`?

The error, `TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'list'` occurs when you try to multiply a sequence (such as a list or a string) by something that is not an integer.

That's because, in Python, sequences like lists, tuples, and strings can only be multiplied by integers. Multiplying a sequence by an integer repeats that sequence multiple times. Here's an example:

```py
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
result = my_list * 2


print(result) # [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
```

However, if you try to multiply a sequence by a list, Python will raise a `TypeError` exception because it doesn’t know how to handle this operation.

Here’s a common situation where this error occurs:

```py
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
result = my_list * [3]


print(result) # TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'list'
```

The error can also occur with tuples:

```py
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
result = my_tuple * [3]


print(result) # TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'list'
```

Or with strings:

```py
my_str = "How are you?"
result = my_str * [3]


print(result) # TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'list'
```

## How to Fix `TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'list'`

To fix this error, make sure you are multiplying sequences by integers only.

Here’s how you can correct it if you're working with a list:

```py
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
result = my_list * 3


print(result) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

Here's how you can fix it if you're working with tuples:

```py
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
result = my_tuple * 3


print(result) # (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)
```

And here's how you can fix it while working with strings:

```py
my_str = "How are you?"
result = my_str * 3


print(result) # How are you?How are you?How are you?
```
