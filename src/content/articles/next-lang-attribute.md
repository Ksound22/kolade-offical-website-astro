The `lang` attribute is not available by default in Next JS. And unfortunately, it's not a good thing for accessibility not to have the `lang` attribute in the root element of your Next JS app.

And if you want to write less code as possible like me, then creating a whole file in `_document.js` to add the `lang` attribute to the root HTML element of your Next JS app might be an overkill.

If you decide to do it with the \_document.js file, this is how it'll look:

```js
import Document, { Head, Html, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';

class MyDocument extends Document {
  static async getInitialProps(context) {
    const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(context);
    return { ...initialProps };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Html lang="en">
        <Head />
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}

export default MyDocument;
```

To me, this is too much code. Thatâ€™s why I'll show you how to add the `lang` attribute to the root element of your Next JS app with the built-in `next.config.js` file.

## How to Add the lang Attribute to your Next Website with the `next.config.js` file

Head over to your next.config.js and add this object:

```js
i18n: {
    locales: ['en'],
    defaultLocale: 'en',
  },
```

Save the file and restart the server so this can reflect. The `en` value of the locale key represents the value your lang attribute will have.

By the time you inspect your website, you should see something like this:
