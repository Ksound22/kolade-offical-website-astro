Indeed, you can view the page source of a website on your mobile phone – be it Android, iPhone, or any other type of mobile phone.

But let me tell you how I stumbled on that feature. I discovered the "lang" attribute was not showing on my website (this website) – a bad thing for accessibility. So I added it and quickly wanted to see how it looks.

However, my laptop was already overworked for the day. So I decided to view it on my phone. But how? That’s what I'm going to show you in this article.

## How to View the Page Source of a Website on your Phone

If you've ever viewed the page source of a website on a phone, there's probably something you haven’t noticed – whenever you right-click and select "View page source", "view-source:" is always prepend to the URL of the website.

So, if you view the page source of this website, look in the address bar and you should see something like:

```bash
view-source:https://www.koladechris.com
```

And if you view the page source of freeCodeCamp.org, the URL becomes:

```bash
view-source:https://www.freecodecamp.org
```

Since this is just an address bar, you can attach "view-source:" to the front of a website address and you'll be able to see the page source.

I did that on my phone with Chrome mobile and this is what happened:

If it happens all the codes of the page source are in one line, check line-wrap:

This feature is not peculiar to Chrome, it should work on any other browser. This is how it looks on Firefox mobile:

And this is how it looks on Edge mobile:

The way both Edge and Chrome mobile displays it is almost the same thing. Maybe it's because they're both Chromium-based browsers.

## Wrapping Up

That’s how you can view the page source of any website on your mobile phone.
