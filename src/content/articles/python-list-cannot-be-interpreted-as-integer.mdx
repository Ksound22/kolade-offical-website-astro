In Python, using a list directly in a built-in function that expects an integer input will result in the error `TypeError: 'list' object cannot be interpreted as an integer.

Let's look at a few causes of the error and how you can fix each of them.

## What Causes the List Object Cannot be Interpreted as an Integer Error?

A good example of what causes the error is using a list in the `range()` function:

```py
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

for i in range(my_list):
 print(i) # TypeError: 'list' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
```

If you also use a list as the step parameter of the `range()` function, the error will be triggered:

```py
step = [2]

for i in range(0, 10, step):
   print(i) # TypeError: 'list' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
```

Another built-in function that expects an integer is `round()`. SO, using a list in it will trigger the same error:

```py
value = 3.14159
decimal_places = [2]

rounded_value = round(value, decimal_places)# TypeError: 'list' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
```

`enumerate` is another function that expects an integer as its optional `start` parameter. If you go ahead and use a list for that, you'll get the error:

```py
items = ['apple', 'orange', 'grape']
start = [1]

for index, item in enumerate(items, start=start):
 print(index, item) # TypeError: 'list' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
```

## How to Fix the List Object Cannot be Interpreted as an Integer Error

If you're working with the `range()` function and its causing the `TypeError: 'list' object cannot be interpreted as an integer` error, use the length of the list instead by wrapping it in the `len()` function:

```py
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

for i in range(len(my_list)):
 print(i) # 0 1 2 (in their respective lines)
```

Using `len()` on the list will return the length of the list, which is a valid integer.

Since three items are in the `my_list` list above, that integer would be `3`, hence the `0 1 2` result.

If using the `enumerate()` in a code causes the error, find a way to make sure the start parameter is accepting an integer, not a list.

This is incorrect:

```py
items = ['apple', 'orange', 'grape']
start = [1]

for index, item in enumerate(items, start=start):
 print(index, item)
```

This is correct:

```py
items = ['apple', 'orange', 'grape']
start = [1]

for index, item in enumerate(items, start=len(start)):
 print(index, item)
```

This is also correct:

```py
items = ['apple', 'orange', 'grape']
start = 1

for index, item in enumerate(items, start=start):
 print(index, item)
```

I hope this article helped you fix the error. Thank you for reading!
