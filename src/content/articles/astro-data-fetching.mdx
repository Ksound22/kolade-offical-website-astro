Like I said on Twitter (now X) a while ago, Astro is the only framework that makes everything ridiculously uncomplicated for you.

In this article, I want to show you how ridiculously uncomplicated it is to fetch data in Astro using a simple API from JSON Placeholder.

## How to Fetch Data in Astro

To get started, I have installed an empty Astro project. Here are the prompt choices I made during the installation:

Here's the initial folder structure of the project:

You only need the traditional `fetch` API to fetch the data. Open up a code fence inside `src/pages/index.astro` and paste this inside it:

```js
---
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts")
 .then(res => res.json())
 .then(data => console.log(data))
---
```

That's all you need, but Astro has a beautiful way to enhance and simplify this. You might also want to pass the data into the template so you can see it in the browser. Keep reading so I can show you this.

  The `data` from the code above will not be logged into the browser console but
  the server console. That's because every code in the code fence is rendered on
  the server.

To simplify the data fetching, Astro has a top level `await` built-in, so you don't need an async function to use it. YOu can use this for the data fetching:

```js
const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
const data = await response.json();

console.log(data);
```

In the template, you can stringify the data for a start:

```js
Data: {
  JSON.stringify(data);
}
```

Then map through it:

```html
<body>
  <h1>Astro Data Fetching</h1>
  {data.map((post:any) => (
  <div>
    <h2>{post.title}</h2>
    <p>{post.body}</p>
  </div>
  ))}
</body>
```

  If you want the data client-rendered, you can open up a script tag and fetch
  the data there.

Thank you for reading!

If you want to fetch the data from a headless CMS, look through the Astro docs for data fetching from a CMS, and the CMS you want to use.
